### What is this?

SufjanViz is a Shiny for R dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the discography of Sufjan Stevens and my own music listening tendencies.

***
### Where's the data from?

Lyric data and album art collected from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Sufjan-stevens)

My music streaming data is collected from a data takeout request from [Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/) (I highly recommend doing this yourself if you aren't happy with the limited statistics of Spotify Wrapped!)

Other track data scraped from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) using the [spotifyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spotifyr/index.html) wrapper

Word clouds generated using [Wordcloud2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud2/vignettes/wordcloud.html)

All other plots produced with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

All code and data available [on GitHub](https://github.com/zaynesember/SufjanViz)
