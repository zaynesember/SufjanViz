# Motivation

- passion for music, having a "subject-area" expertise, cite being in top x% of listeners and playing his music constantly
- passion for working with time and text data
- wanting to learn how to make interactive data analysis in a non-academic context
- wanting to understand my favorite artists' musical tendencies, do they match with my listening experience
- wanting to understand my own music preferences

# Sufjan's Musical Tendencies

## Priors

  - Sufjan's style varies significantly album to album, i.e. tempo, arrangement, 
    but with common threads through them, i.e. bird references and certain chord progressions
  - Certain albums are sonically and lyrically similar, most notably Michigan and Illinois, but also ADP and Javelin
  - Certain albums are more depressing, namely Carrie & Lowell, and so would expect them to differ systematically from
    others that feature both sad and upbeat songs
    
    
## Findings


# My Music Listening Tendencies

## Priors

- I listen to sadder Sufjan songs later in the day and during the winter
- I'm more likely to make it all the way through songs with more words per minute
- I listen to the least Sufjan in the summer

## Findings

# Shortcomings and Next Steps

- Clearest limitation is only doing 1 artist, would like to extend to artists adjacent to Sufjan that I also
  listen to like Bon Iver, Angelo De Augustine
- Streaming history is limited from September 2023 to September 2024 and is likely biased because Javelin was released in October 2023
  - Also biased by roadtrip playing a shared playlist
